# iris-flower-classification
I used machine learning modules to complete this project.
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species.
The model's primary goal is to automate the classification process based on the distinct characteristics of each iris species.
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, 'Sepal length', 'Sepal width', 'Petal length', 'Petal width'.
The Iris dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset to understand classification and clustering algorithms in machine learning.
By using the features of the iris flowers, researchers and data scientists can classify each sample into one of the three species.
Finally, completed this project with gaining basic knowlwdgw on machine learning.
